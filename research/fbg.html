									<p>The goal of this project is to design a new form of birefringent fiber Bragg grating for strain sensing in embedded applications. This was accomplished by combining the use of finite element, analytical, and experimental methods. Fiber Bragg gratings use a periodic change in modulation in the core of the fiber to create a peak wavelength response to an input fiber signal. A strain experienced on the core of the fiber changes this period of modulation, resulting in a change in wavelength response and thus sensing capabilities.</p>
									<p>The goal of this project is to design a new form of birefringent fiber Bragg grating for strain sensing in embedded applications. Birefringence occurs when a fiber core is compressed diametrically, creating two indices of refraction at right angles to one another in the fiber core. This generates two peak responses, and the movement of these peak reaponses as shown in the diagram reflects various strain states in the core.</p>

									<p>The birefringent fiber was embedded in an epoxy cylinder and underwent diametric loading. The change in transverse strain in the fiber core was then interpreted using finite element and experimental techniques, and then an analytical solution to predict the far field epoxy strain was generated. In addition, multiple tests were conducted rotating the sample under the loading. This allowed for a modeling of the measurement capabilities when the load applied does not align with the axes of the core indices of refraction in the fiber. This was fairly successful, with the exception of the cure profile of the epoxy causing for a slight distortion effect when the load was closely aligned with the axis of the fiber core.</p>
