									<p>The intent of this project was to design an irreversibly failing shock failsafe for high consequence applications, utilizing teams of Sandia Labs interns. 
									An important requisite of the project was that the design incorporate at least 70% additive manufactured components. Our team, the incredible intern innovators, managed to create a bi-stable beam design which incorporated 98% additively manufactured components. The beam was made to contain a series of “teeth”, with an electromagnetically conductive material laid on top. The beam switches states when undergoing the necessary shock to trigger the device, and as a result the teeth are ejected, breaking the conductive circuit and triggering device failure.</p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="additive_manufacturing\Slide18.jpg" alt="" /><i>The beam in the INSTRON for mechanical testing</i></span>
									<p>The beam was designed in CAD and was analyzed using both analytical and experimental methods. The variables modified to achieve the proper failure regime were the thickness, material, number of teeth, number of tooth cavities, and amount of external weight attached during testing. The forces impressed were measured using static loading on an INSTRON as shock testing was note available</p>

									<p>Following the mechanical testing phase, the finalized composite beam was printed as well as the teeth and the conductive material. It was then tested under haversine shock conditions and successfully met the requirements for the device.</p>
